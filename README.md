# pdfdrive-viewonly-solver

To use this script you only need to open the link drive of the pdf file whose access rights are view only.

Then press ctrl+shift+j.

Then scroll through the entire page of the file so that it opens completely. This aims to save the cache on the device that we use.

If everything is open, go to the console tab and paste the coding from code.js

The pdf.save string can be adjusted according to the name of the file that we will save.

If everything is ready, enter, and the file will automatically download and wait a while.
